Projective Geometry

Points
-use three-dimensional vectors to save two-dimensional points
not (0,0,0)

-represent a point (a,b) as the vector(a,b,1) (homogenization)
-normalization: scale the last component to 1
(multiply (a,b,c) by c^-1)
-de-homogonization: normalize, ignore last component
(4,6,2)->(2,3,1)->(2,3)
-scalar multiples represent the same point
-de-homogonization is not possible if the last component is 0

Lines
-represented by three-dimensional vectors, too
not(0,0,0)
-generate a plane by the line and (0,0,0), take a normal vector
-scalar multiples represent same line
-one line is not contained in space(R^2): line at infinity represented by (0,0,1)

point p is on a line l <=> inner product <p,l>=0

line l through points p and q: L=p*q

intersection points of two lines l and m: p=l*m

l = b*d
m = a*c
p = l*m = b*d*a*c

points at infinity
-intersections of parallel lines
(1,0,1)*(2,0,1)=(0,1,0)
direction of the lines

-connection of them is the line at infinity
(1,0,0)*(0,1,0)=(0,0,1)
use special cases
parallel line m to a line l through point p
q=l*(0,0,1)
m=p*q=p*l*(0,0,1)
-orthogonal direction to (a,b,0) is (-b,a,0)
-projection q of point p to line l
a=l*(0,0,1), m=p*a
q=l*m-l*p-(l*(0,0,1))
area of a triangle through points p, t, q

projective transformations:
-Linear map on homogenous coordinates
-take a 3 dimensional matrix A, map p to Ap
